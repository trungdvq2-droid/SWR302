# Context:
In fact, when developing a new software, the software development team must describe the software requirements 
in software requirements specification before they do the design and coding. 
They describe the software requirements by using text, formulas, drawing models and table description.

# Project Scenario: FPTU Connect Portal
The FPT University Student Affairs Office wants to develop a new centralized system named "FPTU Connect Portal". 
This portal will help students discover, join, and manage activities for all university-recognized clubs 
(e.g., F-Code, F-Music, Vovinam). Currently, club management is fragmented, using spreadsheets for members and social media for promotion.

The FPTU Connect Portal needs to have many functions. It must allow students to sign in (using @fpt.edu.vn email accounts), 
browse the list of clubs, search for upcoming events, join a club, and register for an event. 
It must allow Club Presidents to manage their club's profile, approve new members, 
create new events, and track event attendance. 
It must also allow Faculty Advisors to approve new club applications and approve major events. 
The system must integrate with the FAP system to verify that a user is an active student. 
Use case approach is one of the most effective ways to describe the software requirements.
